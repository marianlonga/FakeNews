Fake News
=========

A project I have worked on during my 2017 summer research internship at Imperial College London's Data Science Institute, supervised by Axel Oehmichen and Miguel Molina-Solana. 

The project utilizes data analysis and machine learning to identify fake news tweets based on the tweet metadata, as related to the 2016 US election.
